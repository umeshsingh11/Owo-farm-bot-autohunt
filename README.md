OwO Farm Bot Auto-Hunt

Overview
The OwO Farm Bot Auto-Hunt script automates gameplay for the OwO game on Discord. Using discord.py and pyautogui, this Python script interacts with Discord channels, detects specific messages, and performs game actions to simulate a human player. The bot sends random chat messages, executes various game commands, and manages breaks to keep the activity pattern natural.

Automated Gameplay: Performs game actions like "OwO hunt," "oh," and "OwO battle" with randomized intervals.
Realistic Interaction: Sends predefined chat messages to simulate user engagement.
Customizable Settings: Easily adjust the bot token, server ID, channel ID, and other parameters.
